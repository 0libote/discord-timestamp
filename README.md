## 🤖 An Experiment in AI-Assisted Development

This project was created as an experiment to explore the capabilities of AI in modern web development.

The vast majority of the code in this repository, from the React component structure to the styling and logic, was generated by an AI coding assistant. Human intervention was minimal, primarily focused on:

- Providing the initial prompts and feature requirements.
- Making minor adjustments and refactoring.
- Assembling the final components.

As such, this project serves as a case study on the effectiveness of AI-driven development for building a functional, single-purpose web application.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Select a Date and Time:** Use the date and time inputs to choose your desired moment.
2.  **Choose a Timezone:** Select the timezone in which your selected date and time reside. You can search for your specific timezone.
3.  **Copy the Code:** Find the format you like from the list. Click the "Copy" button next to it.
4.  **Paste in Discord:** Paste the copied code (e.g., `<t:1728403200:R>`) directly into a Discord chat message. When you send it, it will render as a dynamic, localized timestamp for everyone.
